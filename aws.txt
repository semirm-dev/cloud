Region -> VPC -> AZ -> Subnet -> EC2
Subnet IP range is created from VPC CIDR
Same subnet can not be shared across AZs

Route table:
- determine where traffic from subnet will go (destination)
- created on subnet, every subnet must have one (by default main route table from VPC is assigned)
- a subnet can be in only one route table
- one route table can be used in many subnets
- local route table is for VPC destination

Internet Gateway: internet access for VPC, EC2
NAT Gateway: connectin between subnets

NACL:
- firewall on subnet
- stateless,
- outbound/response not automatically enabled

Security Group: 
- firewall on EC2, precisely on Network Interface which is attached to EC2
- multiple Network Interfaces can be attached to EC2
- stateful
- outbound/response automatically enabled but only from client/internet

VPC peering: connection between VPCs, hard to manage, manually connect all VPCs, CIDR can not overlap between VPCs
Transit Gateway: connection between VPCs, easier to manage, acts like router between VPCs
Direct Connect: connection between corp data center and VPC (to VGW)
Private Link: connection between only selected AWS services in different VPCs (to VPC Endpoint)
