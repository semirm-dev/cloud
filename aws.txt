Region -> VPC -> AZ -> Subnet -> EC2
Subnet IP range is created from VPC CIDR
Same subnet can not be shared across AZs

Created on VPC:
- subnets
- route tables
- internet gateways
- nat gateways

Subnet:
- associated with: route table and nacl

Route table:
- determine where traffic from subnet will go (destination)
- one route table can be used in many subnets
- one subnet can be in only one route table
- local route table is for VPC destination

NACL:
- firewall on subnet
- can be associated with multiple subnets
- stateless
- outbound/response not automatically enabled

Internet Gateway: 
- internet access for instances with public IP
- one per VPC

NAT Gateway: 
- internet access for instances without public IP
- connection between subnets
- sits on public subnet
- allow private subnet to access public subnet which has access to internet

Security Group: 
- firewall on Network Interface which is attached to EC2
- multiple Network Interfaces can be attached to EC2
- stateful
- outbound/response automatically enabled but only from client/internet

VPC peering: connection between VPCs, hard to manage, manually connect all VPCs, CIDR can not overlap between VPCs
Transit Gateway: connection between VPCs, easier to manage, acts like router between VPCs
Direct Connect: connection between corp data center and VPC (to VGW)
Private Link: connection between only selected AWS services in different VPCs (to VPC Endpoint)
